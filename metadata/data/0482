  "description": "The WebtrES Oscibot is a unique robot with an intriguing background. Its box has a vibrant orange color, making it stand out among other robots. The classic buttons give it a touch of nostalgia, reminiscent of the early days of technology. However, its arms and legs are made from the sturdy foundry material, providing durability and strength. The screen, unfortunately, is broken, but that doesn't hinder the robot's functionality. It is still a remarkable member of the WebtrES club, embracing its flaws and showcasing its unique abilities.",
