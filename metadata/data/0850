With its classic box shape and buttons, it carries a sense of nostalgia for the early days of technology. Its arms and legs are designed in a classic style, providing it with both functionality and a sense of charm. The standout feature of Pulse is its laser screen, which enables it to display precise and detailed waveforms with incredible accuracy.",
