  "description": "Sparky is a sentient oscilloscope-themed robot who is proudly a member of the WebtrES club. With its sturdy box body and soldier-like demeanor, Sparky is always ready for action. Its arms and legs, designed like hands hanging down, give it a unique and agile appearance. The screen on its front displays a charming cat, adding a touch of whimsy to its serious exterior.",
