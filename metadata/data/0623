  "description": "RetroVolt is a charming oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With its vibrant red box body, reminiscent of the iconic rossoCorsa color, and retro console buttons, RetroVolt embodies a nostalgic charm. Its sturdy soldier arms and legs give it a strong presence, while its screen displays an adorable cat theme. To top it off, RetroVolt is always wearing stylish glasses, adding a touch of sophistication to its overall appearance.",
