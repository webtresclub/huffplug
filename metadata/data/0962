With a box-shaped body resembling a classic console, Circuit stands out with its rocket arms and legs. Its screen is uniquely designed to display a playful cat animation, adding a touch of nostalgia. Circuit wears stylish glasses as an accessory, giving it a sophisticated and intellectual appearance.",
