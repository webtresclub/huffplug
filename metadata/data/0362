  "description": "Circuit is a retro-inspired oscilloscope-themed robot belonging to the WebtrES Club. With its box-like body resembling a cat, Circuit stands out among its robotic peers. Its arms and legs have been constructed from durable foundry materials, providing it with unmatched strength and durability. However, what sets Circuit apart is its broken screen, which adds a touch of uniqueness to its appearance. Despite this flaw, Circuit remains a beloved member of the club, contributing its skills and abilities to the group's ventures.",
