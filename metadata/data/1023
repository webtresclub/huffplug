  "description": "RetroCat is a robotic oscilloscope who is part of the WebtrES club. With its unique design, it combines the nostalgia of retro gaming with the functionality of an oscilloscope. Its box-shaped body resembles a retro console, complete with buttons for control. Instead of conventional arms and legs, RetroCat has adorable cat-shaped appendages that add a touch of playfulness to its appearance. The screen on its front displays a classic snake game, giving it a unique and interactive interface.",
