  "description": "Retro Rover is an oscilloscope-themed robot belonging to the WebtrES club. With its vibrant red body called 'rossoCorsa' and its vintage 'retroConsole' buttons, this robot radiates a nostalgic charm. Its arms and legs, made from sturdy 'foundry' materials, add a touch of industrial aesthetics. However, its 'broken' screen gives it a unique and enigmatic personality.",
