  "description": "Catalyst is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES club. With its unique features, Catalyst stands out among its peers. It has a cat-shaped screen, which adds a touch of playfulness to its design. The addition of glasses gives Catalyst a studious and intellectual appearance. Catalyst's box-like body and classic button interface make it both functional and retro-chic. Its arms and legs are designed in a hand-down position, allowing it to manipulate objects and navigate its surroundings with ease.",
