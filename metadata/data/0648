  "description": "Pixel is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES club. With its retro console buttons and cat-like arms and legs, Pixel is a unique and playful addition to the club. Its orange box and broken screen give it a distinctive appearance, while its glasses add a touch of sophistication. Despite its broken screen, Pixel is still able to analyze and display electronic waveforms with precision.",
